#SSE

SSE stands for Server-Sent Events. It is a web technology that enables real-time communication between a web server and a client. SSE allows the server to send continuous streams of data to the client over a single HTTP connection, providing a simple and efficient way to deliver real-time updates, notifications, or event-driven information from the server to the client. (text-based format)
